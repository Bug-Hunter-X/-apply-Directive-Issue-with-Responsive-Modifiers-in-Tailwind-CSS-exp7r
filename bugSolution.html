To resolve this issue, it's recommended to avoid using `@apply` with responsive modifiers. Instead, apply the classes directly:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 md\:bg-gray-200">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

This direct approach ensures that Tailwind's responsive system works correctly, overcoming the limitations or inconsistencies encountered with `@apply` in this scenario.  Using utility classes directly provides better control and predictability in these situations.
